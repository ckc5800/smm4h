I know you think thatÔøΩs bullshit, but your refusal to help out and just give them the fucking code means that I AM STUCK UNTIL FUCKING MONDAY WITHOUT ANYTHING STRONGER THAN TYLENOL.
1083879043177631746	l11297	@realDonaldTrump So tell me Donnie, what's adderall going for this week?
1083909191759216647	l11298	like the most i've done is like idk adderall if that counts if not weed don't worry y'all i haven't completely lost it.
1084079063780741125	l11299	@realDonaldTrump Far tougher to he immediately followed by good relations. Hmm sounds like you are lying through your Adderall caked teeth old man.

1084169432195203072	l11301	@realDonaldTrump I believe tRUmp crashed from his Adderall high after 13 Twitter rants. How long will your nap be after snorting all that Adderall? Rest up, I think you still have 10 more tweets in you today! Only you can do it with your yuuge, bigly brain!

1084827653813796870	l11308	@realDonaldTrump Maybe stop snorting adderall and resign #RussianMafiasWhore
1084844538236157955	l11309	Pause ÔøΩ adderall is nothing like meth bc oral route of administration. Smoking meth on a regular basis is equivalent to popping an IR tablet per a hit. Meth immediately crosses the blood brain barrier. Adderall does not. DonÔøΩt be irredeemably retarded in my curious cat

In JhamariÔøΩs eyes Larz was someone he looked up to and was forced to be skinny to be his friend. Larz repeatedly mailed him Adderall daily.
1084855310987214855	l11313	@tedlieu @coton_luver @NRA And then the Nashville comment today that was quickly deleted. The walls are closing in on him and he canÔøΩt do enough rails of Adderall to keep ahead of them
1084889563087233028	l11314	@realDonaldTrump Waiting for what? Putin to call? This whole nightmare to end? Your Adderal to kick in?

953640528465285120	l13860	@esaagar @DawnDCS92 Both are correct. Dr. Gupta is correct that his heart Calcium score indicates arterial plaque buildup and the score # is increasing. Dr. Jackson is correct that increase in Crestor dose along with diet/exercise is about all that can be done. His LDL target should be &lt;75, imo.

953711667745120259	l13862	@maggieNYT I'd bet he has a very fatty liver with those Lipid Panel numbers. He's fooling no one. Plus cholesterol plaques in his arteries. Crestor and other cholesterol lowering drugs DO NOT PREVENT A FIRST HEART ATTACK. There is hope.

Lots of people inherit the tendency to high amounts of bad cholesterol. The doctor referred to panels in several discussions where he stated that there was not enough of an increase to suggest more testing were necessary.
953717213613223936	l13864	@realDonaldTrump I don't know what your dr will say of this but my mother in law could not take crestor cuz of muscle ache side effect so she tried flaxseed oil but doubled the dose and it worked!

953831365400809474	l13871	@kurteichenwald Crestor is a heavy duty Statin. I can't take it. I take Pravastatin, which lowered by LDL to under 100. If Trump's LDL cholesterol is still 143, yeah that's bad. What is Trump's HDL b/c is that's low he's really in bad shape.
